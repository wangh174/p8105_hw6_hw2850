###Problem 2
```{r}
#read data
homicide = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

```{r}
homicide_tidy = homicide %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", " ,state), #create city_state variable
    disposition = if_else(disposition %in% "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)
    ) %>% #make disposition a binary variable
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>% #Only select white & black
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), #make age numeric
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White"),
         disposition = as.numeric(disposition)) %>% 
  select(!c(city, state))
```

```{r}

Baltimore_fit = Baltimore %>% 
  glm(disposition ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = ., family = binomial()) #run glm

  broom::tidy(conf.int = T) %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) %>%

```{r}

###Problem 3
```{r}
birthwt = read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
Interested in investigating the relationship between mother's pre-pregnancy weight (ppwt) and baby's birth weight.

```{r}
birthwt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppwt, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) #plot the trend between ppwt and bwt
```
